# <h1><b>E-Restaurant Web Application</b></h1>

Welcome to the **E-Restaurant** web application! This project was built using **PHP** and **JavaScript**, with a customized frontend based on a standard template to meet specific requirements.

## 📌 <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
The **E-Restaurant** application enables a contactless dining experience by allowing customers to scan a QR code placed on their table. Upon scanning, the customer is redirected to an online menu where they can place their order. All order information is seamlessly transmitted to the chef or admin for further processing.

### <b>Key Features:</b>
- **Contactless Ordering**: Customers can browse the menu and place their orders directly from their smartphone by scanning the table-specific QR code.
- **Real-Time Order Management**: Admins (or chefs) receive live order updates and have the ability to **accept** or **reject** orders based on availability.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Simple and intuitive admin interface for managing orders efficiently.

## 💡 <h2><b>Purpose</b></h2>
The primary motivation behind building **E-Restaurant** was to ensure **safety and convenience** for customers and restaurant staff during the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing contact and streamlining the ordering process.

## 🛠️ <h2><b>Technologies Used</b></h2>
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS (customized template)
- **Database**: MySQL for storing and managing orders
- **QR Code System**: Integrated QR code scanning for accessing the menu

## 🚀 <h2><b>How It Works</b></h2>
1. **Customer Scans the QR Code**: Each table has a unique QR code that directs the customer to the restaurant’s menu.
2. **Placing an Order**: The customer selects items from the menu and places an order through the web interface.
3. **Order Received by Admin**: The chef or admin receives the order details in real-time and can either accept or reject the order.
4. **Admin Actions**: Once the order is accepted, it is prepared. The admin can manage and track all orders through a simple interface.

## 🧑‍💻 <h2><b>Usage</b></h2>
This application is user-friendly and designed for easy integration into existing restaurant setups, requiring minimal training for staff and customers alike.
